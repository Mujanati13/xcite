## Steps to configure Firebase for your project:

1. **Go to the Firebase Console**
   - Visit https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create a new project** (or select existing one)
   - Click "Add project"
   - Enter project name (e.g., "x-cite-properties")
   - Follow the setup wizard

3. **Add a web app to your project**
   - Click on the web icon (</>) in the project overview
   - Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "x-cite-frontend")
   - Click "Register app"

4. **Get your Firebase configuration**
   - After registration, you'll see the Firebase SDK configuration
   - Copy the configuration object

5. **Enable Firestore Database**
   - Go to "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" for development
   - Select a location close to your users

6. **Update the config.js file**
   Replace the placeholder values in `src/firebase/config.js` with your actual Firebase configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyB...", // Your actual API key
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdef",
  measurementId: "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
};
```

## Firestore Security Rules

For development, you can use these rules (in Firestore -> Rules):

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to property_exports collection
    match /property_exports/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Change this for production!
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Change the security rules for production to restrict access based on your authentication requirements.

## Collection Structure

The app will create a `property_exports` collection in Firestore with documents containing:
- `exportDate`: Timestamp when the export was created
- `exportedBy`: User who performed the export
- `propertiesCount`: Number of properties in the export
- `properties`: Array of exported property data

## Testing the Integration

Once configured, you can test the Firebase integration by:
1. Selecting some properties with status=1 in the PropertyTable
2. Clicking the "Export" button
3. Checking the Firestore console to see if the export data was saved
4. Verifying that the CSV file was downloaded
